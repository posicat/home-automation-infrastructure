== Sending Data ==
*destination* - (required) List of channels that should receive the data block
*source* - (optional) The name of the node sending data into the hub.  The hub should validate this information for correctness, and fill in / correct it in if it's missing.
*date* - (optional) The current date in UTC format.
   NOTE : Recommended for non-realtime communication with the hub, should be added by the hub if it is missing when the request is received.
